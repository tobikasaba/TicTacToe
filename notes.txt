Minimax algorithm:
This is a decision making algorithm built off a maximising minimising concept. 
That is, youâ€™re trying to maximise your win while your opponent is trying to minimise their loss.

Logic used is:
players representation (-1 for O and +1 for X)
formula = (players represennation) * [(the number of spaces left at point of win {if there are no empty squares, 1 is used}) + players representation]
Maximiser respensents X
Minimiser function represents O.
In the decision tree of which move to make, X favours the greater posotive value while O favours the lesser values.
